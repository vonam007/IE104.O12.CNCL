# Note:
- header and footer are reusable components that are used in multiple pages. They are not part of the page itself.
- main file is a general file for all page doing things like setting font family, font size, color, etc or general functions that are used in multiple pages.
- pages in folder pages are different pages with different content, required different css and js files. They are not reusable.

# Naming classname convention

- use camelCase for naming variables and functions, className.
Example: 
+ const myVariable = 1;
+ function myFunction() {
    return 1;
}
+ <div className="myClass"></div>
